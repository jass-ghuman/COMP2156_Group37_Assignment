The role of DevOps engineers in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) 
cannot be overstated. DevOps engineers are responsible for designing, implementing,
 and maintaining the tools and processes that enable continuous integration, continuous delivery,
  and continuous monitoring of software applications. By mastering DevOps practices, students gain a deep understanding of the SDLC and learn how to orchestrate the entire software development process from code commit to production deployment. Embrace DevOps and unlock the full potential of your software development projects.
